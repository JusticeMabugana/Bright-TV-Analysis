## 📺**Bright-TV Analysis**
This repository shares insights on viewer and viewership trends for Bright TV between 1 Jan 2016 and 31 March 2016. It also focuses on factors that influence consumption.

It also provides recommendations on growing viewership and initiatives that can be taken to attract new users.


## **🔎Findings**

- Gauteng and Western Cape combined account for over 50% of viewership for the period.
  
- The majority of our audience consists of young adults (18-35 years), representing **58.51%** of our viewers.

- It's worth highlighting that our minor viewers surpass the number of senior viewers in terms of viewership.

- The majority of our audience tends to watch shows for brief periods (0-15mins).

- The largest portion of our audience typically watches shows during the morning and afternoon hours.

- Females only account for 8.93% of the viewership data, while males accounted for 89.59% of our viewers.


## **💹Recommendations**

- We might consider launching a channel featuring bite-sized shows, as the majority of our audience prefers content within the 1 to 15-minute range.

- Additionally, we could create kids' channels with extended sing-along programs, similar to the popular shows available on YouTube (like Baby Shark). 
This would not only attract a younger audience but also extend viewership for non-sports related programs.

- Given that the Cricket World Cup is a 2011 event and the viewership data is from 2016, this indicates an opportunity to introduce more tournament highlights, which could enhance the longevity and duration of viewership for our shows.

- **Sponsorship of Women’s Sports:** We could invest in female sports to boost viewership among women, who currently represent only 8.93% of the audience.

- **Region-Specific Packages:** We could create tailored packages for each province, featuring a selection of locally produced shows. This approach would not only foster relatable content but also empower and engage individuals from those regions.

- **Loyalty Discounts:** We could implement price reductions for our loyal customers.
